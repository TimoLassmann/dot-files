;;; Commentary:

;; This file sets up the essentials for incorporating my init org
;; file.  This is known as "literate programming", which I think is
;; particularly helpful for sharing Emacs configurations with a wider
;; audience that includes new or potential users (I am still very new
;; myself).
;;
;; See my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

;;; Code:

;; This variable is incremented in prot-emacs.org.  The idea is to
;; produce a list of packages that we want to install on demand from an
;; ELPA, when `prot-emacs-autoinstall-elpa' is set to nil (the default).
;;
;; So someone who tries to reproduce my Emacs setup will first get a
;; bunch of warnings about unavailable packages, though not
;; show-stopping errors, and will then have to use the command
;; `prot-emacs-install-ensured'.  After that command does its job, a
;; re-run of my Emacs configurations will yield the expected results.
;;
;; The assumption is that such a user will want to inspect the elements
;; of `prot-emacs-ensure-install', remove from the setup whatever code
;; block they do not want, and then call the aforementioned command.
;;
;; I do not want to maintain a setup that auto-installs everything on
;; first boot without requiring explicit consent.  I think that is a bad
;; practice because it teaches the user to simply put their faith in the
;; provider.
