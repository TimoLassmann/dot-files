;;; Commentary:

;; Prior to Emacs 27, the `init.el' was supposed to handle the
;; initialisation of the package manager, by means of calling
;; `package-initialize'.  Starting with Emacs 27, the default
;; behaviour is to start the package manager before loading the init
;; file.
;;
;; See my dotfiles: https://gitlab.com/protesilaos/dotfiles

;;; Code:

;; Initialise installed packages
(setq package-enable-at-startup t)

(defvar package-quickstart)

;; Allow loading from the package cache
(setq package-quickstart t)

;; Do not resize the frame at this early stage.
(setq frame-inhibit-implied-resize t)

;; Disable GUI elements
(menu-bar-mode -1)
(tool-bar-mode -1)
(scroll-bar-mode -1)
(mouse-wheel-mode -1)
(setq inhibit-splash-screen t)
(setq use-dialog-box t)                 ; only for mouse events
(setq use-file-dialog nil)

(setq inhibit-startup-message t)
(setq inhibit-startup-echo-area-message "prot") ; read the docstring
(setq inhibit-startup-screen t)
(setq inhibit-startup-buffer-menu t)
(message "EARLY")
